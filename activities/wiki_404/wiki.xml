    <name>Flexible groupings: Share your ideas</name>
    <intro>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Grouping learners is one strategy that allows instructors to effectively differentiate instruction. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img width="350" height="233" title="Group of adults" alt="Group of adults discussing in a library." src="@@PLUGINFILE@@/teacher_interacting_with_students.jpg" complete="true" style="margin: 0px;" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Groupings should not be fixed; whole class, small groups, pairs, and collaboration with groups outside of the classroom can be used at different times throughout the semester or year. Instructors should continuously group and re-group based on the content, the project, and ongoing evaluations. Similarities and differences in learners’ language, background knowledge, motivation, engagement, and interests can also be used to determine groups. Successful grouping allows instructors to form groups of learners who would benefit from the same type of instruction and  support, and also to form groups of learners who would benefit from others' strengths and weaknesses. Successful grouping provides learners with the opportunity to collaborate with and learn from their peers. as well as to explore different roles and responsibilities. &lt;/span&gt;Add your thoughts and resources on how to manage flexible groupings--and don't forget to sign your contribution! (Put your name in parentheses at the end of your contribution.)&lt;/p&gt;</intro>
